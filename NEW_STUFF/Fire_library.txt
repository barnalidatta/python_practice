The provided Python code defines a simple calculator using the fire library, which enables command-line interfaces (CLI). 
The code creates a class called ArithmeticProcessor with a method named calculate_double that takes a value and returns its double.
In the last few lines, the code checks if it is being run directly (__name__ == '__main__'), and if so, 
it uses the fire.Fire() function to turn the ArithmeticProcessor class into a CLI. This means that when the code is 
executed from the command line, users can pass arguments to perform calculations.

%cat calculator.py
import fire

class ArithmeticProcessor(object):

    def calculate_double(self, value):
        return 2 * value

if __name__ == '__main__':
    fire.Fire(ArithmeticProcessor)

    
%%bash
./run -p calculator.py calculate_double 15
